I helped deliver a report on family food security in Middletown, CT during a semester-long course with the Wesleyan Quantitative Analysis Center. Our team distributed the USDA Food Security Survey using Qualtrics, analyzed the results, and wrote a report for the Middlesex Coalition for Children. By using longitudinal data, we found that childhood food insecurity increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic.
