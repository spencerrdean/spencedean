This project was a collaboration with my friend [Conner](https://connersexton.github.io/) while we were computational research assistants at the Wesleyan Media Project. By querying data from the Facebook Ad Library API, we tracked references to the pandemic from 2020 U.S. presidential candidates and their affiliated pages. For the analysis and visualizations, we used R, Python, and Tableau. We found that despite large spending—Trump spent $2.4 million in the timeframe we examined—presidential candidates didn't frequently mention the COVID-19 pandemic in Facebook ads.
